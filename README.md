# Learn Terraform Functions

Learn what Terraform functions are and how to use them.

Follow along with the [Learn tutorial at HashiCorp Learn](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/functions?in=terraform/configuration-language).

In this tutorial, you create an EC2 instance running a pre-built webapp. You will:

- use the templatefile function to create a user_data script to dynamically configure an EC2 instance with resource information from your configuration.
- use the lookup function to pass a map output to a variable as an input.
- use the concat function to concatenate and output multiple lists of rules to an AWS Security Group.
